[Syllabus](https://mroberts.emerson.build/courses/vm-303-01/sp23/) (outside Canvas)

------------------------------------------------------------------------

#### Overview

This course considers the nature and contemporary forms of digital culture. Broadly speaking, this can be defined as the diverse range of symbolic practices through which communities affirm and maintain their cultural identities using digital media devices and interfaces in a globally networked society. While these practices are structured by deeply unequal power relations, are contradictory, and often come into conflict with one another, collectively they constitute what may be considered a global digital culture.

A key component of the course is the automation of various forms of creative production, from writing to the visual arts, by natural-language processing computational systems (generally referred to as "artificial intelligence" or "AI"). The course addresses some of the many issues raised by such systems, with a particular focus on questions of aesthetics and the increasingly contested relationship between artists and algorithms. While such systems now demonstrably pass the Turing Test (i.e. pass as human or their products as human-produced), they also compel us to reconsider what we mean by "art," or "intelligence" itself.

A major theme of the course is the changing status of the **future** as a social imaginary. It has been suggested that while we live today in the futures imagined by writers and filmmakers since George Orwell's novel *1984* (1949) and films like *2001: A Space Odyssey* (1968), *Blade Runner* (1982, set in 2019 and later 2049), or *Soylent Green* (1973, set in 2022), postmodern society has become so absorbed in commemorating its own past that it has become incapable of imagining its own future, dystopian or otherwise. As the course shows, historical projections of the future (often referred to as *retrofutures*) have paradoxically themselves become objects of postmodernist nostalgia.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

#### Format

This is primarily a critical-thinking course, although it includes a practical and production component. This means that it encourages you to think reflexively and analytically about the digitally-mediated cultural practices that the course considers, as well as to participate in them; for example, you will be invited to experiment with image-synthesis and text-generating software and analyze the results using key concepts and theoretical frameworks.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

#### Outcomes

By the end of the course, students will:

-   have acquired a deeper understanding of the social, cultural, and political dimensions of digital technologies and networked communication;
-   be able to apply critical thinking to contemporary developments in digital culture using relevant analytical concepts and both qualitative and quantitative methodologies such as cultural analytics;
-   understand basic principles of algorithmic image synthesis on a variety of platforms;
-   have reflected upon and discussed the larger significance of machine learning systems within global networked societies.
