Yet what exactly do we mean by the cinematic? Is it defined technically (frame rate), stylistically (deep/shallow focus), or by other criteria (projection, screen size)? This course explores the concept of the cinematic by considering the place of cinema within the larger field of contemporary digital culture.\n\nThe course focuses on two apparently contradictory developments: on the one hand, the migration of the concept of the cinematic to television, music video, video games, social media, and immersive environments; on the other, the evaporation of the cinematic from cinema itself as it becomes saturated by the visual design of comics, smartphone interfaces, and social media. Contrary to familiar claims that cinema is “over,” the course will show that cinema has been reinventing itself throughout its history, a process that has continued up the present in the algorithmically-enhanced versions of the earliest actuality films uploaded to YouTube.\n\n## Format\n\nThis is primarily a critical-thinking course, although it includes a practical and production component. This means that it encourages you to think reflexively and analytically about the digitally-mediated cultural practices that the course considers, as well as to participate in them; for example, you will be invited to experiment with image-synthesis and text-generating software and analyze the results using key concepts and theoretical frameworks.\n\n## Outcomes\n\nBy the end of the course, students will:\n\n-   have acquired a deeper understanding of the social, cultural, and political dimensions of digital technologies and networked communication;\n-   be able to apply critical thinking to contemporary developments in digital culture using relevant analytical concepts and both qualitative and quantitative methodologies such as cultural analytics;\n-   understand basic principles of algorithmic image synthesis on a variety of platforms;\n-   have reflected upon and discussed the larger significance of machine learning systems within global networked societies.\n\n## Texts\n\nSelected chapters from the texts below will be made available as PDFs; you are nevertheless encouraged to purchase at least several of texts that are of interest and read more of them.\n\nNote on formats: A number of texts listed in the bibliography are available as e-books and/or audiobooks. You are encouraged to make use not only of print media but also of these screen-based and audio formats.\n\n## Schedule of Classes\n\n*Week 1*\n\n**I.
